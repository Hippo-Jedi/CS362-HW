1. For my social media software, using the TDD would be useful for the messaging system.

  - Create a test that makes sure both users follow eachother
    before messages can be exchanged.
  - Create code that verifies one user is following the other
    and vice a versa.
  - Create a test that verifies the request message if only one 
    user follows the other.
  - Create a code that makes it so user properly recieve message
    requests that they can accept or deny from users that they 
    do not follow. 
  - Create a test that verfies the encryption process of messages 
    as they are being sent.
  - Create code that correctly encrypts and decrypts messages as 
    they are sent and recieved by users.
